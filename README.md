# Hitch-Hiker's-Travel-Guide

## Introduction

When making short (and sometimes spontaneous trips) what are the main things we should consider? 💭  

I think the hitch-hiker has to consider 5 main things:  
  - 🚍 Transportation.  
  - 🏚️ Lodging.  
  - 🥖 Food (🛍️ Groceries or 🥡 Restaurants ).  
  - 🌦️ Weather.  
  - 👮 Safety.
